# Typing Trials
Online multiplayer game similar to TypeRacer (without all the flair)

Users type a given paragraph of text and their typing speed and accuracy are calculated. Multiple users can join an *Arena* to compete in real-time.
Test scores can be saved to the database if the user is logged in and can check those in their profile.
